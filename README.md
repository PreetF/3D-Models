# 🧱 3D Models Repository

This repository showcases a collection of 3D models designed using **Rhino 3D** and rendered using **KeyShot**. These models were created as part of personal exploration in 3D modeling, product visualization, and design communication.

---

## 📁 Contents

- `/Rhino3D_Models` – Native `.3dm` files designed in Rhino3D
- `/Keyshot_Renders` – High-quality render images exported from KeyShot
- `/Screenshots` – Screenshots of renderings for quick previews or documentation

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Rhinoceros 3D (Rhino)** – NURBS-based 3D modeling
- **KeyShot** – Real-time ray tracing and global illumination rendering software

---

## 📌 Highlights

- Focused on **product design**, **surface modeling**, and **aesthetic visualization**
- Designed keeping real-world proportions and manufacturability in mind
- Rendered with realistic materials, lighting, and camera perspectives
